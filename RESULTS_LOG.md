|---|------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|-------------|-------|
| 1 | 2025-10-21 | Original | Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarked, Title (6) | RandomForest | 0.8373 | 0.7703 | 0.0670 | - | Initial submission, high CV/LB gap |

## Key Metrics

### Current Best
- **LB Score**: 0.7799 (Submission #2)
- **Remaining Submissions**: 8

### Progress
- **Total Improvement**: +0.0096 (1.25%)
- **Gap Reduction**: 0.0670 ‚Üí 0.0484 (-27.8%)

## Analysis

### Submission #2: RF_Conservative

#### Positive Results ‚úÖ
1. **Gap Reduction**: CV/LB gap reduced from 0.067 to 0.048 (-27.8%)
   - This confirms our hypothesis: simpler models generalize better
   - Lower overfitting = better LB performance

2. **Slight LB Improvement**: +0.0096 improvement
   - Moving in the right direction
   - Conservative approach is working

3. **Model Stability**:
   - Used only 4 features (vs 6 in original)
   - Conservative RF parameters worked as intended

#### Analysis of Gap ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Expected**: LB 0.78-0.81
- **Actual**: LB 0.7799
- **Why lower than expected?**
  1. Train/Test distribution differences still affecting performance
  2. OOF score (0.8283) may still be optimistic
  3. Feature set may need refinement

### Insights

1. **Reducing Features Helps**: 6 features ‚Üí 4 features improved generalization
2. **Conservative Approach Works**: Gap reduced significantly
3. **Still Room for Improvement**: Gap of 0.0484 suggests some overfitting remains

## Next Steps - Strategic Analysis

### What We Learned

From Submission #2 results:
- ‚úÖ Simpler models generalize better (confirmed)
- ‚úÖ Reducing features reduces overfitting (confirmed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still have a 0.048 gap to close
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to find the right balance between CV and LB

### Hypothesis for Next Submission

**Theory**: The 0.048 gap suggests we need even simpler models OR different feature combinations.

**Two Approaches**:

#### Approach A: Even Simpler (Lower Variance)
- Try models with CV ~0.79-0.80
- Accept lower CV for better CV/LB alignment
- Example: LR_V5 (OOF 0.7946, very stable)

#### Approach B: Feature Engineering
- Current features: Pclass, Sex, Title, Fare
- Maybe Fare distribution difference is hurting us
- Try replacing Fare with Age or other features

### Detailed Next Actions

#### Option 1: Test LR_V5 (Logistic Regression)
**Rationale**:
- OOF: 0.7946 (closer to current LB 0.7799)
- Most stable CV (Std: 0.0057)
- Minimal overfitting (Gap: -0.002)
- Expected LB: 0.77-0.79

**Pros**:
- Safest option, highest certainty
- May achieve better CV/LB alignment
- Won't waste submission

**Cons**:
- Limited improvement potential
- May only match current score

#### Option 2: Feature Set Experiments
**Try different feature combinations**:

1. **V8_Family**: Pclass, Sex, Title, Age, IsAlone
   - Replace problematic Fare with Age + IsAlone
   - Age has smaller distribution gap

2. **V5_WithEmbarked**: Pclass, Sex, Title, Age, Embarked
   - Remove Fare entirely
   - Focus on more stable features

3. **V2_WithAge**: Pclass, Sex, Title, Age
   - Minimal feature set
   - Only most reliable features

#### Option 3: Ensemble Approach
**Try Voting Ensemble**:
- Combines LR + RF + GB
- OOF: 0.8327 (Hard Voting)
- May reduce variance through diversity
- Expected LB: 0.78-0.80

### Recommended Next Submission (#3)

Based on the gap reduction success, I recommend **continuing the conservative approach**:

ü•á **PRIMARY: LR_V5 (submission_V5_WithEmbarked_LR.csv)**
- **Why**: OOF 0.7946 is very close to current LB 0.7799
- **Expected**: LB 0.77-0.79 (safe, predictable)
- **Goal**: Establish a stable baseline with minimal gap
- **Risk**: Low

**Strategy**:
- If LR_V5 achieves LB 0.78-0.79 with small gap ‚Üí Use this as baseline
- Then incrementally add complexity to improve

ü•à **ALTERNATIVE: Feature Engineering with RF**
- Create new model with: Pclass, Sex, Title, Age, IsAlone
- Remove Fare (largest distribution difference)
- Use same conservative RF parameters
- Expected: LB 0.78-0.80

## Submission Plan (8 Remaining)

### Phase 1: Establish Stable Baseline (Submissions #3-4)
- #3: LR_V5 (establish low-gap baseline)
- #4: Feature variant (test Age vs Fare)

### Phase 2: Optimize Best Performer (Submissions #5-7)
- Based on #3-4 results
- Fine-tune best approach
- Try ensemble if single models plateau

### Phase 3: Final Push (Submissions #8-10)
- Use best insights from previous submissions
- Final hyperparameter tuning
- Reserve #10 for absolute best

## Technical Notes

### Why Gap Reduced?
1. **Fewer Features**: 6 ‚Üí 4 reduced complexity
2. **Conservative Parameters**:
   - max_depth=4 (vs default 5)
   - min_samples_split=15
   - min_samples_leaf=5
3. **Feature Selection**: Dropped Age and Embarked (both had distribution gaps)

### What's Causing Remaining Gap (0.048)?
1. **Fare Distribution**: Train mean 32.2 vs Test mean 35.6 (diff: 3.36)
2. **Possible Solutions**:
   - Remove Fare entirely
   - Bin Fare more aggressively
   - Use rank-based transformation
   - Try Age instead of Fare
