# Submission #5 Strategy and Recommendation

## Situation

**Original Plan**:
- Create model with FareBin + Pclass_Sex interaction
- Expected OOF: 0.820-0.825
- Expected LB: 0.787-0.792

**Challenge**:
- Python environment doesn't have pandas installed
- Cannot run model generation script
- Must select from existing submission files

## Available Options Analysis

### Current Best Scores
- **Best LB**: 0.7799 (Sub #2: V3_WithFare_RF)
- **Best No-Fare**: 0.77751 (Sub #4: NextGen_RF_NoFare_V2)

### Existing Submission Files

Based on previous model generation, we have:

#### Option 1: submission_V3_WithFare_GB.csv 🥇
**Model Details**:
- Features: Pclass, Sex, Title, Fare (4 features)
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting
- Parameters: n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.05
- Expected OOF: ~0.8372 (from previous runs)

**Expected Performance**:
- Using Fare-based model formula from #2:
  - #2 (RF with Fare): OOF 0.8283 → LB 0.7799, gap 0.0484
  - Formula: LB ≈ OOF - 0.048 for Fare-based models
- **Predicted LB**: 0.8372 - 0.048 = **0.7892** ✓

**Pros**:
- Highest expected OOF among available models
- GB often generalizes better than RF
- Should beat current best (0.7799)
- Expected improvement: +0.0093 over current best

**Cons**:
- Contains raw Fare (distribution mismatch issue)
- Gap likely ~0.048 (acceptable but not ideal)

**Risk**: Medium - Relies on Fare but GB may handle it better than RF

---

#### Option 2: submission_NextGen_Ensemble_LR_RF.csv 🥈
**Model Details**:
- Features: Pclass, Sex, Title, Age, IsAlone (5 features - no Fare)
- Algorithm: Weighted Voting (LR:2, RF:1)
- Expected OOF: ~0.798 (from previous runs)

**Expected Performance**:
- Using no-Fare ensemble formula:
  - Gap expected: ~0.025-0.028
- **Predicted LB**: 0.798 - 0.027 = **0.771**

**Pros**:
- No Fare (stable across train/test)
- Ensemble reduces variance
- Predictable gap (<0.03)

**Cons**:
- Lower expected LB than Option 1
- Won't beat current best (0.7799)

**Risk**: Low - Very stable but won't improve LB

---

#### Option 3: submission_V6_Original_GB.csv 🥉
**Model Details**:
- Features: Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarked, Title (6 features - full set)
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting
- Expected OOF: ~0.8249

**Expected Performance**:
- Using full feature set formula:
  - Gap expected: ~0.048-0.055 (more features = more overfitting)
- **Predicted LB**: 0.8249 - 0.050 = **0.7749**

**Pros**:
- Uses all available features
- GB algorithm

**Cons**:
- More features may increase overfitting
- Won't beat current best

**Risk**: High - Too many features, unlikely to improve

---

#### Option 4: submission_V5_WithEmbarked_GB.csv
**Model Details**:
- Features: Pclass, Sex, Title, Age, Embarked (5 features)
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting
- Expected OOF: ~0.8204

**Expected Performance**:
- No Fare (good!)
- But lower OOF than Option 1
- **Predicted LB**: 0.8204 - 0.030 = **0.7904** (too optimistic)
- More realistic: 0.8204 - 0.035 = **0.7854**

**Pros**:
- No Fare
- GB algorithm
- 5 features (balanced)

**Cons**:
- Embarked may add noise
- OOF may be optimistic

**Risk**: Medium

## Recommendation

### 🥇 PRIMARY CHOICE: submission_V3_WithFare_GB.csv

**Rationale**:

1. **Highest Expected LB**: 0.7892 (beats current best by ~0.009)

2. **GB May Handle Fare Better**:
   - GB uses sequential learning
   - May be less sensitive to distribution differences than RF
   - Conservative parameters (max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.05)

3. **Proven Feature Set**:
   - Same features as #2 which achieved 0.7799
   - Just different algorithm (GB vs RF)

4. **Risk/Reward Analysis**:
   - **Upside**: LB 0.78-0.79 (new best!)
   - **Expected**: LB 0.785-0.790
   - **Downside**: LB 0.775-0.780 (still competitive)

5. **Strategic Value**:
   - Tests if GB can use Fare better than RF
   - Provides data point for Fare-based GB models
   - If successful, opens path for more GB optimization

**Expected Outcomes**:
- ✅ **Excellent**: LB ≥ 0.79 (gap <0.045)
- 🟡 **Good**: LB = 0.78-0.79 (gap ~0.047)
- 🟠 **Acceptable**: LB ≥ 0.7799 (beats current best)
- ❌ **Disappointing**: LB < 0.7799

### 🥈 BACKUP CHOICE: submission_V5_WithEmbarked_GB.csv

**When to Use**:
- If you prefer a more conservative approach
- If you want to avoid Fare entirely

**Expected**: LB 0.78-0.785 (may still beat 0.7799)
