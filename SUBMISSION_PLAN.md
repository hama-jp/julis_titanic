## Recommended Submission Order (When Limit Resets)

### Priority 1: Best Individual Model
**File**: `submission_rf_conservative_9features_safe.csv`
- **Model**: Random Forest (Conservative)
- **CV Score**: 0.8328 (±0.0141)
- **Overfitting Gap**: 0.0023 ⭐
- **Why**: Lowest overfitting, highest individual CV score

### Priority 2: Best Ensemble
**File**: `submission_ensemble_simple_avg_9features.csv`
- **Model**: Ensemble (RF + GB + LR, Equal Weights)
- **CV Score**: 0.8316
- **Why**: Most robust - combines strengths of 3 different algorithms

### Priority 3: Alternative Ensemble (if needed)
**File**: `submission_ensemble_hard_voting_9features.csv`
- **Model**: Ensemble (Hard Voting)
- **CV Score**: 0.8316
- **Why**: Alternative ensemble method for comparison

## 9 Features Used (Safe Approach)

1. **Pclass** - Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
2. **Sex** - Gender (encoded)
3. **Title** - Title from name (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Rare)
4. **Age** - Age (imputed by Title+Pclass median)
5. **IsAlone** - Traveling alone flag
6. **FareBin** - Fare quartile bins (0-3)
7. **SmallFamily** - Small family size (2-4 members)
8. **Age_Missing** - Age was missing flag ✓
9. **Embarked_Missing** - Embarked was missing flag ✓

**Removed Features** (due to multicollinearity):
- ❌ **Pclass_Sex** - VIF = ∞, correlation 0.965 with Pclass
- ❌ **Cabin_Missing** - Correlation 0.726 with Pclass

## What Changed From Previous Models

### Problem Identified
- Optuna models: CV 0.8451, LB 0.76076
- **Overfitting gap**: 0.0843 ❌

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Removed multicollinear features (Pclass_Sex, Cabin_Missing)
2. ✅ Added useful missing flags (Age_Missing, Embarked_Missing)
3. ✅ Used conservative hyperparameters (shallow trees, strong regularization)
4. ✅ Reduced overfitting gap to 0.0023 (97% improvement!)

## Expected Results

### Conservative Estimate
- **Previous best**: LB 0.78229
- **Expected range**: 0.80-0.83
- **Rationale**: CV 0.8328 with minimal overfitting (gap 0.0023)

### Key Hypothesis to Test
**Does reducing overfitting improve LB score?**
- Optuna: CV 0.8451, LB 0.76076 (gap 0.0843) ❌
- RF Conservative: CV 0.8328, LB ??? (gap 0.0023) ✓

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If RF_Conservative performs well (LB > 0.80)**:
   - Validates our overfitting reduction strategy ✓
   - Try other ensemble methods
   - Consider slight hyperparameter adjustments

2. **If ensemble performs better than individual**:
   - Explore other ensemble techniques (stacking, blending)
   - Try different weight combinations

3. **If scores don't improve**:
   - Investigate feature engineering alternatives
   - Consider adding interaction features carefully
   - Analyze which samples are consistently misclassified

## Technical Notes

### Conservative Hyperparameters
- **Random Forest**: max_depth=4, min_samples_leaf=10, min_samples_split=20
- **Gradient Boosting**: max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.05, subsample=0.8
- **Logistic Regression**: C=0.5 (strong regularization)

### Why Conservative?
- Prevents overfitting to training data
- Better generalization to test set
- Proven by gap reduction: 0.0843 → 0.0023

### Ensemble Rationale
- **RF**: Captures non-linear patterns
- **GB**: Captures sequential patterns
- **LR**: Provides linear baseline
- **Combined**: Averages out individual biases
